    <p >As a Unity Game Developer at Hoodie Games, I have had the incredible opportunity to use my passion and technical expertise to create engaging, visually stunning mobile games that captivate audiences around the world. As the only programmer at the company, I have played a critical role in developing and maintaining all of our games, using my programming skills to bring our ideas to life and deliver high-quality gaming experiences to our players.

      Throughout my time at Hoodie Games, I have worked closely with my fellow co-founders to shape the direction and identity of the company, playing a key role in defining our vision and strategy. I have always been committed to our success, working tirelessly to overcome the challenges that come with being a solo programmer in a mobile game development company, and using my technical expertise to drive our growth and success.
      
      I take great pride in what we have accomplished at Hoodie Games, and I look forward to continuing to develop innovative, exciting games that push the boundaries of what is possible in the world of mobile gaming. Throughout the years I was able to develop the following
